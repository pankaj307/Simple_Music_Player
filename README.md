# Simple_Music_Player
This is a simple music player based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This project used some online fonts, and elements. So, it needs to be connected to internet for running in a proper way.
This project contains some per-loaded music files and images related to those music files.

You can add or remove music or image of your choice by following the following steps -
  1. Add your music file in the music folder and image related to this music file in the images folder which are already created.
  2. Go to the JavaScript file and add the title of your song, name of the music file, and name of the image file.
  3. Keep the format similar as already exixting files.
  4. Do not remove the first song in the already exixting list because it will cause the default page to mis-behave.
  5. If you still want to remove the first song, you have to  change its name from HTML file also so that it will change the default song and add your song in place of that song.
